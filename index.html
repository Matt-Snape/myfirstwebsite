          <h3>Hello!</h3>
          <p>
            Hi, I'm Matt; I'm a Chemistry and Physics teacher and head of
            department who works in an 11-18 School in Cheshire. I am lucky
            enough to have got married to a wonderful woman from the Netherlands
            this year as well as moved house! It's been a busy year but I am
            currently capping it off by branching out into the world of coding
            by completing a course with Hyperiondev in Full Stack Web
            Development and Software Engineering. In my free time I mainly enjoy
            travel abroad to see family and for fun, seeing my nieces, nephews
            and Godchildren, spending time with my cat Bob, gaming with friends
            online, cooking and getting out into the great outdooors.

          <h3>My cat</h3>
          <p>
            We have had Bob for just over a year now. I was resistant to the
            idea of getting a cat at first because I was more of a dog person
            but I was so wrong! Bob is great company when I'm doing my coding as
            she sits on the windowsill and watches the world outside
            occasionally jumping down for a cuddle... and to mess some of code
            up. If you look closely at the picture here you can see her planning
            the correct time to pounce!

          <h3>Cooking</h3>
          <p>
            I really enjoy cooking, I find it cathartic and peaceful. I enjoy
            putting a slow cook on and then going for a walk and coming back to
            a hearty meal. This Christmas I cooked for twenty guests who were
            all crammed in to our relatively small house... this was not so
            relaxing and we had to use garden furniture but I still enjoyed it.

          <h3>Travel</h3>
          <p>
            I have been lucky to travel to many places worldwide but perhaps my
            highlight was when I took a group of students to do charity work in
            Cambodia for a month. I also visit the Netherlands regularly to see
            my wife's family and we have just booked to go to Amsterdam the
            weekend of this year's king's day celebration and I am really
            excited to go and see all the orange! A place I have always wanted
            to visit is South Africa but I sadly can't afford to after my
            wedding so will have to start saving again.

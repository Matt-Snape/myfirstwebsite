          <h3>My local - Sandbach</h3>
          <p>
            I live in the Town of Sandbach which is in Cheshire, a very flat
            part of the country but with some excellent walks. Sandbach is a
            small town full of history with the ancient crosses and cobbled
            streets being a highlight. If you walk out of town you can follow
            one of the many canals out into the countryside or head across
            fields. One of the lcoal sights is Jodrell Bank which is a great
            sight to walk around as well as a Centre of Scientific Interest. It
            also hosts live music and a few years ago I saw one of my favourite
            bands, Elbow, perform there live.

          <h3>The Roaches - The Peak District</h3>
          <p>
            I was born on the egde of the Peak District National Park which is
            Englands oldest national Park. Growing up I would cycle and walk
            extensively in the Peaks but my favbourite area is The Roaches. The
            is a rocky outcrop overlooking a reservoir with an excellent pub by
            the water. You can either hike, boat or take climbing gear and take
            on one of the many climbing routes which snake their way through the
            crags.
